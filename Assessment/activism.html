<h1>What Activist groups do</h1>
      <p> The main point of an activist group is to take action to create change, but that can include a number of different things, and also depends on the approach the group has decided to take. Usually the main activities activist groups organise include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protests and marches, where lots of people gather with banners and signs to draw attention to an           issue or to ask for change.</li>
  <li>Street campaigning, where volunteers talk to the public about their work to raise awareness and             recruit new supporters.</li>
  <li>Digital campaigning, where awareness is raised through activities such as online petitions, social         media content and emails to local MPs.</li>
  <li>Political lobbying, where volunteers try to engage politicians and political parties and get them to       support their campaign.</li>
  <li>Putting up posters and distributing flyers to raise awareness of the issue.</li>
  <li>Mass action, such as asking the public to participate in a planned event.</li>
  <li>Occupying spaces, such as sitting in the middle of a road or in a building and refusing to move to         raise awareness of a particular issue.</li>
  <li>Striking is also an important form of activism.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>History of Activism</h1>
<p>Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets, tracts, and books to disseminate or propagate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause. <br>Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology.<br> Left-wing and right-wing online activists often use different tactics.<br> Hashtag activism and offline protest are more common on the left.<br> Working strategically with partisan media, migrating to alternative platforms, and manipulation of mainstream media are more common on the right.<br> In addition, the perception of increased left-wing activism in science and academia may decrease conservative trust in science and motivate some forms of conservative activism, including on college campuses.<br> Some scholars have also shown how the influence of very wealthy Americans is a form of activism.</p>
