    <H1> FORESTS</H1>
<p>
  Forests are home to around 80% of the world’s land biodiversity including many varieties of trees, plants, animals, birds, insects and fungi working together in complex ecosystems.
  Forests cover a third of global land area. Around half of this is relatively intact, and over a third is primary forest, with no visible sign of human activity and where ecological processes have been left undisturbed.</p>
  <H1>How do forests help stop climate change?</H1>
  <p>Forests around the world also help to stabilise the climate. They do this by absorbing almost one-third of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels every year – around 2.6 billion tonnes.
  Because forests also store carbon, deforestation releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
  <h1>Why are forests being destroyed?</h1>
  <p>The world’s tropical forests are most often cut down or burned to make way for industrial food and cosmetics production.
  In the case of the Amazon rainforest and other South American forests, fires are started by farmers to clear land to rear cattle for meat and dairy, or to grow soya for animal feed. So much deforestation happens in this way in South America that it is the main cause of deforestation worldwide.
  In the tropical rainforests of Indonesia and the Congo, palm oil plantations are a key cause of deforestation. And in the Great Northern Forest, which stores more carbon than all the tropical forests in the world, logging companies fell trees for products like tissue paper.
  Protecting forests is important for defending human rights too. All across the world, people that live within forests rely on them for shelter, food, energy, medicine, and income. Indigenous Peoples particularly depend on forests – and indigenous lands include some of the best-protected and most biodiverse regions in the world.
  Since 1990, it is estimated that 420 million hectares of forest have been destroyed. The rate of deforestation slowed between 2015 and 2020, at an average of 10 million hectares per year, down from 16 million hectares per year since 1990.

  <ul>

    <li>Protect existing forests first - it is more important to look after the forests we do have before we plant acres of new forests.</li>
    <li>Put local people at the heart of tree-planting projects. The projects are much more likely to work if local communities are involved from the start of a project because people feel a sense of pride if they have helped.</li>
    <li>Maximise biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals - other outcomes such as encouraging species conservation, improved living conditions for communities, food growth and better quality soil and water should also be considered.</li>
    <li>Select the right area for reforestation - rather than planting new forests in areas that are already doing good work for the environment, consider using areas that have been degraded (places that used to be forests but have been destroyed in the past).</li>
    <li>Use natural forest regrowth wherever possible - rather than actively planting trees, which can be expensive, try to protect the areas that have been degraded so they grow back naturally.</li>
    <li>Select the right tree species that can maximise biodiversity. When natural growth is not possible and tree planting is required, picking the right trees is crucial say the scientists. Using a mix of species, it can encourage a much richer ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Make sure the trees are resilient to adapt to a changing climate - using seeds that are suitable for the local climate or the possible projected climate is sensible.</li>
    <li>Plan ahead - think about what the seeds or trees will need in order to keep on thriving in the future.</li>
    <li>Learn by doing - use the knowledge of the forests that local people have gained over the generations of living nearby.</li>
    <li>Make it pay - make sure the money made by replanting the forests is more than the profit of the land being used as something else such as farm land.</li>
